Tutorial
========

Turbo-Django allows you to easily integrate the Hotwire Turbo framework into your
Django site. This will allow clients to receive blocks of html sent from your web server
without using HTTP long-polling or other expensive techniques.  This makes for
dynamic interactive webpages, without all the mucking about with serializers and JavaScript.

In this tutorial we will build a simple chat server, where you can join an
online room, post messages to the room, and have others in the same room see
those messages immediately.
